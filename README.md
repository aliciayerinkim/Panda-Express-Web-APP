# PollyTheProject

We made a website for Panda Express that can be used by servers, managers, and customers to order for pickup or delivery. Our target audience is the servers, managers, and customers of a Panda Express restaurant. We want the website to be accessible to a variety of personas with various disabilities and accessibility needs. Our system design includes a single landing page for all users, which branches to a server/manager side and a customer side. The manager has options to manage inventory and see several manager views.

    In the previous meeting we discussed how we wanted to go about changing our product with what our feedback said on the Expert Panel. From this discussion, we decided to condense the inventory buttons on the manager dashboard and simplify the ordering for the servers. We also discussed the best ways to go about Google Maps API and how to begin O-Auth login. We concluded that O-Auth login will need more discussion in the future when implementation is about to take place.

  ### Minutes from Previous Meeting
    From the previous meeting, we had a lot of tasks that were in progress and not yet completed, so we discussed solutions for tasks such as google mapping, excess report for the backend, and designing of the checkout view. Our biggest concern at this meeting was to make sure nobody had any blockers that were halting them from completing their tasks. We focused on removing any confusions of what to do for each task and made sure any task that was currently blocked, would be unblocked soon.
